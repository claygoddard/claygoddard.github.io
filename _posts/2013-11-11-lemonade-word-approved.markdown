My first game in the app store...I'm excited and nervous all at the same time. I am so happy to have completed the game after a year and a half of on and off (mostly off) development!

Check out a quick overview of the game <a href="{{ site.url }}/lemonadeworld/">here</a>.

If the game looks interesting, support me by purchasing it! I will be forever grateful.

Also, if you have any praise, comments, hate-mail, etc, you can contact me at my email located at the bottom of the page.

Whether this game is a success or not, I look forward to continuing development on both Lemonade World and future game ideas.
